## Simple hints
1-If you intend to change the range(decrease | increase) you just need change the maxNumber amount:

    function initialSettings() {
     let settings = {
        maxNumber: 1500, //changeable amount
        maxValue: 2,
        minValue: 2 
    }
    .......
    .....
    ...

2-If you hover on a composite number you will break down the composite number to primes numbers and you'll see it in a moveable box.
